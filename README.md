## Objective
The objective of this project was answer the following question:

>**Will it rain tomorrow?**

## Data Source
The data was provided during a course at Ironhack, but a similar dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package).

## Resources
- Python
- Jupyter Notbook

## Process
**__Part 1 - Initial Analysis of the Variables__**

_Get the dataset ready to be used in a model_

1. Set the premisses
2. Data cleaning and manipulation
3. Export dataset

**__Part 2 - Baseline Model__**

_Develop a baseline model._

1. Data cleaning and manipulation
2. Develop the model
   - Holdout
   - Standardization
   - Cross Validation
   - Metrics

**__Part 3 - Development of the Final Model__**

_Develop the final model._

1. Data cleaning and manipulation
2. Develop the model
   - Holdout
   - Standardization
   - Feature Selection
   - Hyperparameter Tuning
   - Cross Validation
   - Metrics
3. Answer the question

## Premises
1. The model used will be the **Logistic Regression**.
2. Out client is a **group of friends that will arrive at the Melbourne**.
   - The location is **Melbourne Airport**
3. Today is **25/06/2017**.
4. Right now is **nighttime**.
   - **Not all features are available right now**.

## Results
- The probability of **not rain** tomorrow it's:0.74228993;<br>
- The probability of **rain** tomorrow it's: 0.25771007;<br>
> On 25/06/2017 probaly **will not rain**.
